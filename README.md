# stochastic-sim-aau
Stochastic simulation library for reaction networks. Developed as an assignment for the [Selected Topics in Programming course](https://moduler.aau.dk/course/2022-2023/DSNSWFK212) at Aalborg University (AAU).

## Requirements

- **C++23-compatible compiler** with [`std::generator`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/coroutine/generator) support 
- **CMake ≥ 3.28**
- **[matplotlibcpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp)**  
  Requires:
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
- *(Optional)* **[Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)**  
  Only needed if you want to **render `.dot` files** generated by the simulator.

## Project Structure

- `include/` – Public headers for the core simulation library (species, reactions, simulator, etc.)
- `src/` – Implementation of the simulation library
- `tests/` – Unit tests covering various functionality ([see requirements](#requirements))
- `examples/` – Sample models demonstrating both single-threaded and multi-threaded simulations  
  Each example produces:
  - A plot of the simulation results (via `matplotlibcpp`)
  - A `.dot` file representing the reaction network
- `benchmark/` – Simple benchmarks for comparing single-threaded and multi-threaded performance

## Assignment Requirements

This project was developed to meet the following objectives defined in the *Selected Topics in Programming* assignment:

- ✅ Operator overloading for expressive C++ reaction definitions
- ✅ Pretty-printing of reaction networks (human-readable and `.dot` graph format)
- ✅ Generic symbol table with support for error handling (missing or duplicate keys)
- ✅ Stochastic simulation based on [Gillespie’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillespie_algorithm)
- ✅ Three example models (including Covid-19 [SEIHR Model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8675552/))
- ✅ Visualization of simulation trajectories using external tools (matplotlibcpp)
- ✅ Generic support for a lazy trajectory generation interface
- ✅ Multi-core parallel simulation support
- ✅ Unit tests for various components (Symbol Table, Pretty-printing, etc.)
- ✅ Benchmarking and performance comparison between single- and multi-threaded runs

## Output Visualization

The simulator produces two types of visual output:

- A **reaction network graph** showing the structure of the system (species and reactions), exported as a `.dot` file and rendered with Graphviz (Done manually).
- A **trajectory plot** showing how species populations evolve over time, generated using `matplotlibcpp`.

Below is an example of both visualizations from the same simulation:
